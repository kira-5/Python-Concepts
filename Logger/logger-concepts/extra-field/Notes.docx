1. ) Using Filter
            - Have to pass key in formatter
            - if extra is not passed in logger.info then data will not show

2.) LoggerAdapter
            - Have to pass key in formatter
            - If extra will not pass then also data is showing for that logger

3. Custom LoggerAdapter
- https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#using-loggeradapters-to-impart-contextual-information
          - Use when no need to change formatter
          - Don't want to pass extra field in looging.info('message)


4.) LogRecordFactory
              -  This is particularly useful when you can't change the format OR if your format is shared with code that does not send the unique key (in your case app_name):

Why is that better than using Adapters / Filters?
    - You do not need to pass your logger around the application
    - It actually works with 3rd party libraries that use their own logger (by just calling logger = logging.getLogger(..)) would now have the same log format. (this is not the case with Filters / Adapters where you need to be using the same logger object)
    - You can stack/chain multiple factories
