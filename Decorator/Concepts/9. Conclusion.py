        ! Conclusion:
            
            ? A Decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
            
            ? Functions are first-class objects in Python.
            
            ? We can easily decorate a function using the @decorator syntax.
            
            ? We can pass arguments to a decorator by wrapping them inside of another decorator function.
            
            ? We can apply multiple decorators to a single function by stacking them.
            
            ? Decorators can be used with the methods of a class or the whole class.
            
            ? Classes can also be used as decorators.
            
            ? Decorators in Python have several real-world usages like measuring execution time, authentication, logging, etc.
            
            ? When the inner function modifies the variables of the outer function, you need to use the nonlocal keyword
