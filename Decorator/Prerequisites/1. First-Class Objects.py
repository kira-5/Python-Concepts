    ! First-Class Objects
    
       ? In Python, a function is treated as a first-class object. This means that a function has all the rights as any other variable in the language.
       
       ? That's why, we can assign a function to a variable, pass it to a function or return it from a function. Just like any other variable.
    
       ? Functions are first-class objects in Python.
